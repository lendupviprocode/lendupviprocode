If you canâ€™t afford your current monthly student loan payments, but a lower payment might be doable, then you have a few options.

Borrowers with federal student loans should consider applying for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. This can be a good choice if your current income is low relative to your student loan debt. Your monthly payments under an IDR plan could be as low as $0. Each year, you will need to recertify your income with the federal government, and your monthly payment will be adjusted based on your income and family size.

There are four different IDR plans; which ones will be available to you will depend on the type of federal student loans you have.
